          <li>430 g unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
          <li>185 g powdered sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon matcha powder, culinary grade</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

     <h2>Instructions</h2>
     <h3>Matcha Spongecake</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F and line three 6” cake pans with a round of parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat the egg whites until it becomes foamy. Add in the cream of tartar and continue beating until it becomes frothy soft peaks.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the sugar into the egg whites one spoonful at a time, mixing in between each addition, until it becomes stiff peaks. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate large bowl, stir together the egg yolks, milk, oil, and vanilla extract. Sift in the cake flour and matcha powder. Stir together with a spatula until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the egg white meringue into the egg yolk mixture in 3 additions, folding the batter together in an upwards motion in between each addition. Fold the batter until no streaks remain and batter is fluffy and airy.</li>
            <li>Divide the cake batter evenly into your 3 lined cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake cakes for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Let cakes cool in the pans for about 15 minutes before running a knife around the edges of the pan and inverting the pan to release the cakes. Let cool completely before using.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Matcha Buttercream</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat softened butter on medium-high speed for 10 minutes until it becomes very creamy and pale in colour.</li>
        <li>Add in the powdered sugar, matcha powder, and vanilla extract. Mix on low speed, working your up to medium-high speed for another 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assembling the Cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>On a cake turntable, lay down your first cake layer. Use an offset spatula to smooth an even layer of buttercream or whipped cream on top.</li>
        <li>Top the frosting with a layer of diced strawberries, lightly pressing them down into the frosting so that they stay in place.</li>
        <li>Place another cake layer on top and repeat with the next layer of frosting and strawberries.</li>
        <li>Frost the top and outside of the whole cake with a crumb coat. Chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes before frosting with the final layer of frosting.</li>
        <li>Decorate the top with buttercream lettering and more strawberries, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Recipe Sites</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href>https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chocolate-chip-cookies-108703</a> Epicurious does a good job of keeping the recipe simple and straight to the point. it only included necessary information - a singular photo, a convincing blurb steps, and reviews. Additionally, the colors aren’t over the top or distracting — keeping it an easy to read black and white. </li>
    <li><a href>https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Chinese-Eggplant-With-Spicy-Szechuan-Sauce-9096475</a> Yummly also does a really good job of keeping the recipe itself simple. The first thing you see are the cooking time, calories, a photo, and ingredients: the essentials for cooking the dish. A nice feature is that it allows you to add ingredients directly to an online grocery shopping app. </li>
    <li><a href>https://demo.wprecipemaker.com/list-checkboxes/</a>  I want to add checkboxes for the ingredients list. I think that would be especially helpful when trying to find everything you need. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Recipe Sites</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href>https://canals-amsterdam.nl/</a> I like this site since it has parallax interactive scrolling, which I think make the recipe more interesting as you read it. </li>
    <li><a href> https://medusaoffspace.com/ </a> This site uses moving type to suggest visual movement. I think that it's a cool element that draws your eye to the text. Maybe making it the title of the recipe.</li> 
    <li><a href> https://www.squadeasy.com/en/ </a> I really enjoy when you hover over things on sites and something happens. Here the dog follows your cursor and also a white circle appears when you hover over him. I think this is fun and playful.</li>
