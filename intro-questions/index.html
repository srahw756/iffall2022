    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <p>1. My name is Sarah Wang and I am currently a junior studying communicatoin design and minoring in HCI.</p>
    <p>2. I'm extrememly interested in web design and being able to create interactive websites that are also aesthetically pleasing. I also want to build my own portfolio site and just become more comfortable using HTMl and CSS. </p>
    <p>3. I've taken WebDev and Rapid Prototype Development, both of which used heavy amounts of HTML/CSS.</p>
    <p>4. I hope to design some very pretty interactive web elements/sites. My past experience with HTML/CSS was very limited to backend and I didn't have that much creative freedom so I'm looking forward to design things I want to design.</p>
    <p>5. I think I will be suprised with how much time building the digital space will take. Usually, I will create the design and then it'll be done, however, now you have to design it and then develop it on top of that.</p>
    <p>6. I think that the <a href= "https://myboardwalk.ca/">Boardwalk</a> website is really gorgeous. When you first open the site, a gorgeous visual greets you. Additionally, there are some very nice interactive elements that occur as you scroll down the site.</p>
    <p>7. I think that the <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> website effectively communicates the information they're displaying. I really enjoy how the site mimics a physical newspaper, and I think that adds a lot to the overall readability of the site. </p>
    <p>8. I think that the <a href= "https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnb</a> website does a really good job in communicating their content in an aesthetic manner. You can find everything you need very easily and everything is very cohesive.</p>
